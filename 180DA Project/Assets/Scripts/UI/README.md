## Overview
The goal of the code here is to provide design for the User Interface of our game. These functions load the menu, main, and start scences. These tasks include creating a user profile and displaying the suggestions to the player. Much of this code is to display dropdown menus and to add events such as clicking on a difficuty on the screen or selecting a suggested training mini game. 

## Where the code came from
Some of this code was auto generated by Unity when we dragged on dropped items on the game screen. The code added dealt with the events that happens, such as, clicking on a difficulty button or selecting a training suggestion the dropdown menu.

## Design
We decieded to use dropdown menus and difficultly buttons to give feedback and suggestion for the play to do. Using these GUI interfaces simpliflies what a player has to do in order to change the difficultly.

## Bugs
There are no bugs to report

## Improvements
We can make some improvemnents to the look of the display.
