# Overview
The main job of this source code is to provide functionality for the Big Laser Obstacle and the Small Laser Obstacle classes. This 
includes creating the lasers, moving the lasers and destroying the lasers. 
 
## Where code came from
All the code was through Unity functions.
 
## Decisions Made
The biggest decision made recently was creating a Laser base class and having the Small and Big Laser scripts derive from this class, in order to provide better code design.
 
## Bugs
As of now, there are no bugs seen with either the Big and Small Laser Obstacle scripts.
 
## Future Improvements
As of now, there are no future improvements.
