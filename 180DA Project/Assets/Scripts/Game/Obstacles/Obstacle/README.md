## Overview
The main job of this source code is to provide functionality for the Big Laser Obstacle and the Small Laser Obstacle classes. This 
includes creating the lasers, moving the lasers and destroying the lasers. 
 
# Where code came from
All the code was through Unity functions.
 
# Decisions Made
The biggest decision made recently was changing from GameObjects to using individual scripts. This helped a lot with object-oriented design of classes and less wasted tearing up/down of GameObjects. Now, components (scripts) are added to the main Game Manager Object, which is "creating" the class. 
 
# Bugs
As of now, there are no bugs seen with the Obstacles script. 
 
# Future Improvements
As of now, there are no future improvements.
