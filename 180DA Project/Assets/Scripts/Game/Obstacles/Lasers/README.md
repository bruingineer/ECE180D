# Overview
The main job of this source code is to provide functionality for the individual lasers generated by the Laser Obstacles. The 
Big Lasers have a laser warning component that warns the player (allowing them time to go to safety) and then they rapidly go to the
other side of the screen, with a varying amount of lasers. For the Small Lasers, they are randomly generated and move to the other
side of the screen in a set amount of time. Varying levels of difficulty affect the speed at which they travel as well as how many lasers
are generated.
 
## Where code came from
All the code was through Unity functions.
 
## Decisions Made
The biggest decision made recently was creating a Laser base class and having the Small and Big Laser scripts derive from this class, in order to provide better code design.
 
## Bugs
As of now, there are no bugs seen with either the Big and Small Laser scripts.
 
## Future Improvements
As of now, there are no future improvements.
